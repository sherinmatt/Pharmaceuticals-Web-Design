# Pharmaceuticals-Web-Design

   ## Summary
    * The goal is to utilize statistical modeling (linear regression) to analyze the impact of 4 different anti-cancer pharmaceutical drugs. 
    * Here, we model, mouse weight vs average volume of tumor, for the following drug regimes : Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol and Ceftamin. 
    
   ## Technologies Used:
    * HTML
    * CSS
    * Javascript
    * Linear Regression with Matplotlib
    
  ## Data:
   [Pymaceuticals Data](https://github.com/sherinmatt/matplotlib-challenge)
    
   ## Steps Taken:
    * Main goal here was to look at how anti-cancer drug Capomulin fared compared to other three drugs.
    * Utilized Matplotlib to analyze the mouse_metadata and study_result data files. And to plot the various visualizations.
    * Study Significance: Based on the linear regression scatterplots, there was a positive correlation between mouse weight and average volume of tumor under the Capomulin drug regimen.

    * So, in the website, there are 7 pages:
      *  A dashboard/ landing page
      *  4 visualization pages for each cancer drug.
      *  A comparison pages that displays the four scatterplots with analysis that shows up when we click the plot.
      *  A data page with the table I used to make my scatterplots.
