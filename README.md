* The goal of this project is to analyze impact of 4 different anti-cancer drugs. Here, I compare, mouse weight vs average volume of tumor, for the following drug regimes : Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol and Ceftamin. 
* Main goal here was to look at how anti-cancer drug Capomulin fared compared to other three drugs.
* I utilized Matplotlib to analyze the mouse_metadata and study_result data files. And to plot the various visualizations.
* Study Significance: Based on the scatterplots, There was a positive correlation between mouse weight and average volume of tumor under the Capomulin drug regimen

* So, in the website, there are 7 pages:
* * A dashboard/ landing page
* * 4 visualization pages for each cancer drug.
* * A comparison pages that displays the four scatterplots with analysis that shows up when we click the plot.
* * A data page with the table I used to make my scatterplots.
