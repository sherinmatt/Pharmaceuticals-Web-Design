# Dashboard Visualization of Statistical Modeling

   ## Summary
    * The goal is to develop an interactive website that consists of statistical modeling (linear regression) to analyze the impact of four different anti-cancer pharmaceutical drugs and showcase key insights. 
    * Here, we model, mouse weight vs average volume of tumor, for the following drug regimes : Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol and Ceftamin. 
    
   ## Technologies Used:
    * HTML
    * CSS
    * Javascript
    * Linear Regression with Matplotlib
    
  ## Data:
   [Pymaceuticals Data](https://github.com/sherinmatt/matplotlib-challenge)
    
   ## Steps Taken:
    * Main objective was to look at how anti-cancer drug Capomulin fared compared to the other three drugs.
    * Utilized Matplotlib to analyze the mouse_metadata and study_result data files. And to plot the various visualizations.
    * Utilized HTML, CSS, Javascript to create dashboard.
    
   
   ##
    * So, in the final website, there are 7 pages:
      *  A dashboard/ landing page
      *  Four visualization pages for each anti-cancer drug.
      *  A comparison pages that displays the four scatterplots with analysis that shows up when we click the scatterplot.
      *  A data page that consists of a table with the information utilized to develop the scatterplots.

   ##  Key Insights:
      *  Based on the linear regression model, there seems to be a correlation between mouse weight and average volume of tumor under the Capomulin drug regimen.
